# Tennis Prediction AI

Machine Learning-powered tennis match predictions using advanced algorithms and temporal data analysis

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a sophisticated tennis match prediction system that achieves **65.2% accuracy** using ensemble machine learning methods. The system incorporates multiple advanced features including surface-specific Elo ratings, recent form analysis, and temporal data validation.

## Key Features

### Advanced ML Models
- Random Forest & XGBoost ensemble methods  
- Temporal validation (train on historical data, test on future)  
- Feature engineering with domain-specific insights  
- Hyperparameter optimization for maximum performance  

### Sophisticated Features
- Surface-specific Elo ratings (Hard, Clay, Grass)  
- Recent form analysis (last 10 matches)  
- Head-to-head statistics with temporal awareness  
- Tournament importance weighting (Grand Slams vs Challengers)  
- Age and ranking differentials  

### Interactive Dashboard
- Live match predictions with confidence scores  
- Model performance analytics with visualizations  
- Feature importance analysis  
- Player insights by surface and age groups
